= Introduction =

Stephane is a <a href="foo">tiny</a> shim that makes it trivially easy to serve Django apps with Aspen. The only requirement is that you name your Django project stephane. Then place Stephane in the same directory as your project, and you're all set.


= Details =

Stephane is simply an Aspen magic directory pre-configured for Django. It includes a module called grappelli which adds the Aspen root to PYTHONPATH, and configures Django using stephane.settings.

Please see the "Extending Aspen" documentation for a detailed understanding of how Stephane works:
